# Door of the Mind
Door of Mind is a 2D puzzle platformer. Players assume the role of a burned-out office worker who visits a hospital that mirrors his mind. Each level turns inner struggles into spatial puzzles solved through world-switching, gravity, and mirror doors. The player’s goal is to navigate through doors, activate buttons, and collect keys to uncover buried memories that bring the character closer to inner healing.
